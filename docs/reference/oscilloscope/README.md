# Oscilloscope

The Oscilloscope instrument provides time-domain views of voltages. It contains a built-in Waveform Generator that can control the Moku analog outputs as well.

In normal operation, the Oscilloscope shows the signal present on the two analog inputs but it can be set to loop back the signals being generated (see set_source).
