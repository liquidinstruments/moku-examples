Arbitrary Waveform Generator
============================

The Arbitrary Waveform Generator takes a time-series of voltage values, and
generates the corresponding waveform at the DACs at a configurable rate.

If you are directly using the RESTful API (e.g. using cURL), the instrument
name as used in the URL is `awg`.
