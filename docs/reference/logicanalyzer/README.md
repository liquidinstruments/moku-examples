Logic Analyzer

The Logic Analyzer / Pattern Generator can measure or generate up to 16
channels of digital signal. The output digital signal can be programmed to
Low, High, or a custom pattern.

If you are directly using the RESTful API (e.g. using cURL), the instrument
name as used in the URL is `logicanalyzer`.
