Datalogger 
==========

The Data logger instrument provides file logging and network streaming of
time-series voltage data. It contains a built-in Waveform Generator that
can control the analog outputs as well.

If you are directly using the RESTful API (e.g. using cURL), the instrument
name as used in the URL is `datalogger`.
