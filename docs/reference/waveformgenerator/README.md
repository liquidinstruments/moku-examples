WaveformGenerator Instrument
============================

Supports the generation of Sine, Square and Ramp, Pulse, Noise and DC waves. 

- The output waveforms can also be frequency, phase or amplitude modulated. 

- The modulation source can be another internally-generated Sinewave, the associated analog input channel or the other output channel. That other output channel may itself be modulated
in some way, allowing the creation of very complex waveforms

If you are using the Waveform Generator directly through the REST API, the instrument name as used in the URL is `waveformgenerator`.
