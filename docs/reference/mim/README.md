Multi-instrument mode
===========================

Multi-instrument Mode allows you to run 2 instruments (Moku:Go) or 4 instruments (Moku:Pro) simultaneously, 
with full access to the platform’s analog front-end, internal inputs, and back panel triggering.

If you are directly using the RESTful API (e.g. using cURL), the namespace to use 
in the URL is `mim`.
