# Examples for Neural Network

Here are some examples for how the Moku Neural Network can be used:

- **[Autoencoder](/mnn/examples/Autoencoder)**: Useful for a number of tasks such as denoising, feature extraction, data compression and anomaly detection.
- **[Signal Classification](/mnn/examples/Classification/)**: Helps in identifying patterns in noisy signals, making real-time data processing more accurate and reliable.
- **[Quantum emitter](/mnn/examples/Emitter_control/)**: Improved control scheme for pumping a quantum emitter.
- **[Signal Identification](/mnn/examples/Signal_ID/)**: Analyze a time seties input and identify the signal shape.
- **[Simple Sine wave](/mnn/examples/Simple_sine/)**: A basic model to output a sine wave as a function of the input voltage on a given channel.
- **[Weighed Sum](/mnn/examples/Sum/)**: Output a weighted sum of the input chnnels with an optional bias/offset.
