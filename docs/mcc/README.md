# Moku Cloud Compile

Welcome to the Moku Cloud Compile Beta!

This project is intended to open the Moku to our users by allowing them to
design and implement their own custom functionality. These custom functions
can be deployed next to, and interact with the existing suite of Moku
instruments. This allows you to prototype custom designs, interact with custom
hardware or provide bespoke functions for you specific requirements.

For an overview of the concepts involved in building a system with the Moku
see [Multi-Instrument and Slots](./slots.md)

To get started coding see [Custom Wrapper](./wrapper.md) or try creating a
project with an example template.

Run your design by [building and deploying](./deploying.md) it to your Moku.
