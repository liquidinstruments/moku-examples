# Other Languages using REST
The Moku scripting API is built on top of REST and as such, can be easily accessed from a wide range of languages without "official" driver packages. You can find many examples of this direct usage of the REST API on our [Other Languages Example Page](/examples/other-languages/).

If you don't see your language on the list, please reach out to our [Support Engineers](mailto:support@liquidinstruments.com).
