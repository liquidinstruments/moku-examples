# Phasemeter

The Phasemeter instrument is used to measure the amplitude and change in phase of periodic input signals. Using the auto-acquire feature, it can automatically lock to input frequencies in the range of 2-200MHz and track phase with a bandwidth of 10kHz.

If you are directly using the RESTful API (e.g. using cURL), the instrument
name as used in the URL is `phasemeter`.
