# Multi-Instrument Mode

Multi-Instrument Mode allows you to run several instruments simultaneously. Each instrument may be connected to other instruments, or to external I/O such as ADCs, DACs and Digital I/O as supported by the hardware.

For an introduction to using Multi-Instrument Mode APIs, see our [Getting Started Guide to MiM](../../getting-started/starting-mim.md).

If you are directly using the RESTful API (e.g. using cURL), the namespace to use in the URL is `mim`.
