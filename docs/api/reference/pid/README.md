# PID Controller

The PID Controller allows for dual channel (independent or MIMO) control of voltage-input, voltage-output signals. The PID includes a double-integrator and fully-configurable integrator saturation (anti-windup) and differentiator saturation.

If using the REST API directly, the instrument group name is `pidcontroller`.
