# Clock Divider

This example is designed for the Moku:Go with no changes required.  It could be adapted for the Moku:Pro or Moku:Lab, but would need to output the pulse to an available DAC instead of the DIO port.

## Multi-instrument Mode Configuration

The following configuration will allow you to test the functionality of your MCC design.  The logic analyzer is not required for proper functionality of the MCC design.
