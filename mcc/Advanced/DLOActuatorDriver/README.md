# DLO Actuator Driver
This is a simple example of how to use the Moku:Go Digital I/O to drive an H-Bridge with PWM and decode position encoders.

It takes target positions as register values and drives the actuator to those positions at a configurable speed and with
configurable overshoot to help mitigate mechanical hysteresis.

This is part of a collaboration between Liquid Instruments and Floquet.AI.
