# Arithmetic Unit example

This arithmetic unit example can perform addition, subtraction, or multiplication of two input signals depending on a control register setting. A 2-bit control register to switch between different operations:
- 00 represents Input A + Input B;
- 01 represents Input A â€“ Input B;
- 10 represents Input A * Input B;
- 11 will just pass Input A to Output A.
